### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Cassandra Version Mismatch Remediation in Cluster.
---

Cassandra Version Mismatch Remediation in Cluster is an incident type that occurs when there is a discrepancy in the version of Cassandra installed across a cluster. This can lead to various issues, such as data inconsistencies, node failures, and performance degradation. The incident requires a remediation process to resolve the issue, which may involve upgrading or downgrading Cassandra versions, ensuring consistency across all nodes, and verifying successful synchronization of data. It is essential to address this incident type promptly to prevent further complications and ensure the continuous availability of the cluster.

### Parameters
```shell
export KEYSPACE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export TABLE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export NODE1_NODE2_NODE3="PLACEHOLDER"

export LATEST_VERSION="PLACEHOLDER"

export LINK_TO_LATEST_CASSANDRA_VERSION="PLACEHOLDER"

export CASSANDRA_TARBALL_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export CASSANDRA_VERSION="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check Cassandra version on all nodes
```shell
nodetool version
```

### Check status of all nodes in the cluster
```shell
nodetool status
```

### Check the schema version of the cluster
```shell
nodetool describecluster
```

### Check the difference in schema version across nodes
```shell
nodetool describekeyspace ${KEYSPACE_NAME}
```

### Check the difference in schema version across datacenters
```shell
nodetool describecluster
```

### Check the logs for errors related to Cassandra version mismatch
```shell
grep -r "version mismatch" /var/log/cassandra/system.log
```

### Check the logs for other errors or warnings related to Cassandra
```shell
grep -r "ERROR\|WARN" /var/log/cassandra/system.log
```

### Check the consistency level of the data on all nodes
```shell
nodetool consistency ${KEYSPACE_NAME}.${TABLE_NAME}
```

### Check the repair status of the nodes
```shell
nodetool repair -pr
```

### Check the status of the node's anti-entropy service
```shell
nodetool getsstables ${KEYSPACE_NAME} ${TABLE_NAME} | xargs nodetool scrub
```

### Check the status of the node's incremental repair service
```shell
nodetool verify -pr
```

### A new version of Cassandra was installed on a few nodes, but not all of them, resulting in a version mismatch.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Define variables


nodes=${NODE1_NODE2_NODE3}  # Replace with the nodes you want to check



# Loop through nodes and check Cassandra version

for node in ${NODE1_NODE2_NODE3}

do

  version=$(ssh $node "cassandra -v | awk '{ print \$NF }'")  # Get Cassandra version on node

  if [[ $version == $cassandra_version ]]

  then

    echo "Node $node is running the correct version of Cassandra."

  else

    echo "Node $node is running a different version of Cassandra."

  fi

done


```

## Repair

### Upgrade all nodes to the latest version of Cassandra, ensuring that the upgrade process is completed successfully.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# set the Cassandra version to upgrade to

CASSANDRA_VERSION=${LATEST_VERSION}



# loop through all nodes in the cluster

for node in ${NODE1_NODE2_NODE3}

do

    # check if the node is already running the latest version

    if nodetool -h $node version | grep -q $CASSANDRA_VERSION

    then

        echo "Node $node is already running the latest version of Cassandra"

    else

        # stop Cassandra service on the node

        ssh $node sudo service cassandra stop

        # download and install the latest version of Cassandra on the node

        ssh $node wget ${LINK_TO_LATEST_CASSANDRA_VERSION}

        ssh $node tar zxf ${CASSANDRA_TARBALL_NAME}.tar.gz

        ssh $node sudo mkdir -p /opt/cassandra

        ssh $node sudo mv ${CASSANDRA_TARBALL_NAME} /opt/cassandra

        # update the symbolic link to point to the new version of Cassandra

        ssh $node sudo ln -sfn /opt/cassandra/${CASSANDRA_VERSION} /opt/cassandra/current

        # start Cassandra service on the node

        ssh $node sudo service cassandra start

        echo "Upgraded Cassandra version on node $node to $CASSANDRA_VERSION"

    fi

done


```
